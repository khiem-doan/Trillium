Good morning freeloaders. If you're seeing this you've been graced by the GOAT Khiem. Read the important first, then the general if you're wondering why certain functions aren't running or don't understand anything about the code. 

I am very sure the code works because it has worked for me and at least two other people. So that's nice. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT
- news_scrape is the news scraper (duh)

- headers working is my short report scraper + my SEC scraper. 

TO RUN THE CODE
- run supervisor.py which should run headers + news scrape 
- In order to do so, you will have to download a lot of packages on Pycharm Community version. Install all of those (the list is literally on the top of headers, news scrape, and supervisor, so do that. If you fail to do this step it won't run, and you failed the IQ test. 
- if you want to run news scrape and headers at the same time, just run the supervisor script. That puts all the output into one big code output
  - But if you want to have separate code output for both, run headers, then run news scrape. It's your choice, but I find running supervisor saves me space


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL
- On news scrape, you can run semafor_rohan but make sure that the time delay is not less than 3-4 seconds, I got blocked. Rohan Goswami is the only thing about Semafor that matters so far. 
- you can uncomment any of the threads to run them, just make sure you don't get blocked. I don't run some of them, but most should work.
- I believe I currently don't run culper and a few others, but try to un comment them and have fun. Will they work? Probably, idk, but if you start getting blocked, set the time.sleep for the whole function at least 1 second greater, don't run the code for a day or more, then try again.
- The sound alerts I downloaded manually. For you they will probably just be beeps. Download and save the sounds through Balbakoa and save them under the same name I have them as if you want them to work specifically - for example, for SEC 8ks, saying the word "SEC" instead of just beeping.
  - If you want to change the sounds you will have to change the file mapping in soundboard.py to wherever you have your sounds saved. It's really not the hardest thing in the world GPT 5.1 can probably help.

OTHER SCRIPTS

- Ticker typing test is practicing pressing shift J twice if a ticker pops up. I use this for short reports getting fast asf.
- 13F live works for Nvidia and for berkshire. You are going to have to change the base file every quarter to compare against but it is fast asf
- The rest of the codes are really just tests, the tesla delivery one is not faster than bloomberg.
