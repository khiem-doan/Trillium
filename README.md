Notes

- news_scrape is the news scraper (duh)
- On news scrape, you can run semafor_rohan but make sure that the time delay is not less than 3-4 seconds, I got blocked
- you can uncomment any of the threads to run them, just make sure you don't get blocked. I don't run some of them, but most should work.


-headers working is my short reoprt scraper + my SEC scraper. 



- ticker typing test is practicing pressing shift J twice if a ticker pops up.

- if you want to run news scrape and headers at the same time, just run the supervisor script. That puts all the output into one big code output
